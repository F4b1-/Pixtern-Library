# Contributing

I am happy about everyone who wants to contribute to Pixtern. 
Here's what you have to do:

1. Fork the Pixtern Repo and clone it.


2. Make the changes.


3. Push to your fork and send me a pull request.


4. Now you are waiting for me to take a look at your changes and (hopefully) accept your request.

Thank you!
